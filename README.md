# Voron_CRT_MGN12Carriage
A version of the MGN12 Carriage to hold a modified CR-Touch sensor.  The lower two M3x8 SHCS are replaced with M3x8 BHCS to lower the profile and avoid hitting the CR-Touch.

You will need to modify your CR-Touch to use the [CRTouch-shell](https://github.com/dennistimmermann/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/tmrmn/CRTouch-shell).

## BoM
2x M3x8 BHCS
